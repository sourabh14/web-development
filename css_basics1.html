<!-- 
	CSS
		- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
		- It is the language we use to style an HTML document. It describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
		- The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
		- It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

	CSS Syntax
		- It consists of selector and declaration
		- Selector - html element you want to style eg: p, h1
		- Declaration - contains css property and value. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
		- Eg: p is a selector, color is a property, and red is the property value

	CSS Selectors
		- element Selector - Eg: h1, p
		- id selector - it is unique
		- class selector - can be used to style multiple elements
		- universal selector - for every html element
		- Grouping selector - multiple elements

	Adding CSS
		- Three ways: External, Internal, Inline
		- External css using <link> tag inside <head>

	Text
		- color - to set the color of the text.
		- text-align - to set the horizontal alignment of a text.
		- font-size - sets the size of the text.
		- line-height - to specify the space between lines:

	Background
		- background-color - background color of an element.
		- background-image - By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.
		- background-attachment - whether the background image should scroll or be fixed
		- height and width - used to set the height and width of an element.

	CSS Box Model - The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:
		- border - border-style property specifies what kind of border to display. Shorthand is 'border'
		- margin - Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
		- padding - used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
			- margin and padding are transparent
		- outline - line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".
