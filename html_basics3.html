	- Block and Inline elements
		Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. There are two display values: block and inline.

		Block-level Elements
			- It always starts on a new line.
			- It always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
			- It has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.
			- The <div> element is a block-level element.
			- Other eg: <h1>-<h6>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <header>, <footer>

		Inline Elements
			- It does not start on a new line.
			- It only takes up as much width as necessary.
			- This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

		<div> Element
			- Often used as a container for other HTML elements.
			- It has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
			- When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

		<span> Element
			- It is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
			- It has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
			- When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
			
		class attribute
			- It is used to specify a class for an HTML element. Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.
			- It is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

		id attribute
			- id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element. You cannot have more than one element with the same id 
			- The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
			- Id can be used for bookmark link (explained earlier)

		Iframe
			- An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
			- The ” iframe ” tag defines a rectangular region within the document in which the browser can display a separate document, including scrollbars and borders. 
			- An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document
